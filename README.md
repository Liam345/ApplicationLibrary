### [](https://github.com/liam345/BookstoreApplication#Improvements)Future Improvements

---

The application can be improved by

- Storing books from the api call into browser's localStorage or using a library like redux-persist for caching api requests.
- Currently, I have not implemented TDD tests for my frontend components. I would like to improve this by adding unit tests for dumb react components, as well as tests for redux containers, and react-router components.
- The design of the application can be improved. Design libraries like Bootstrap and ant-design are really good for prototyping. However, In the project I noticed that these design libraries limit me to a certain style. They might not be suitable for building custom or even extensible components.
- Set up CI/CD pipeline, and run unit tests before every merge request. Refernce the following article
  [Building a CI/CD pipeline with CircleCI and Heroku](https://medium.com/99xtechnology/building-a-ci-cd-pipeline-with-circleci-and-heroku-57bae2d0bac0).
