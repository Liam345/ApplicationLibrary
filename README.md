#### []((https://github.com/liam345/BookstoreApplication#Objective)) OBJECTIVE

#### 
Design, build, and deploy a web application in order to improve my skills in the above technologies. It is my first project using Express, Postgres, Node , Sequelize and Redux. This project is my initial step that will enable me to be a rounded Javascript developer.

### [](https://github.com/liam345/BookstoreApplication#Workflow)WORKFLOW
___
I created 2 git repos. One for [Backend](https://github.com/Liam345/LibraryApp) , and the other for [Frontend](https://github.com/Liam345/LibraryAppFrontend) 
The commits done to each of these repos concisely describe the change/ feature set added.
After couple of weeks into the project, I came across this article [Deploy React and Express App to Heroku](https://daveceddia.com/deploy-react-express-app-heroku/). This article explained that I should have client and server code in the same repo to deploy to Heroku . Hence, I created a third repo for Heroku. To prevent this 3 repo hodgepodge, I would be using one repo for client and server side code in my future applications.
My bug fixing methodology was to write each of the issues I faced on 3 X 4 card . I prioritized the issue fixes that I put on the top of the card pile. This methodology helped me to keep track of all the issues I faced.

### [](https://github.com/liam345/BookstoreApplication#Improvements)Future Improvents
___
The application can be improved by 
- Storing books from the api call into browser's localStorage or using a library like redux-persist for caching api requests.
- Currently, I have not implemented TDD tests for my frontend components. I would like to improve this by adding unit tests for dumb react components, as well as tests for redux containers, and react-router components.
- The design of the application can be improved. Design libraries like Bootstrap and ant-design are really good for prototyping. However, In the project I noticed that these design libraries limit me to a certain style. They might not be suitable for building custom or even extensible components.
- Set up CI/CD pipeline, and run unit tests before every merge request. Refernce the following article
[Building a CI/CD pipeline with CircleCI and Heroku](https://medium.com/99xtechnology/building-a-ci-cd-pipeline-with-circleci-and-heroku-57bae2d0bac0).
